# Introduction
I’ve been on a mission to create creamy, rich vegan chocolate ice cream, and it almost stumped me.

My first attempt lacked depth of dark chocolate flavor.
My second attempt came closer, but lacked creaminess.
And my third attempt? Total winner.

Creamy, insanely rich chocolate flavor that’s somewhere between ice cream and gelato. Get your ice cream maker, kids. We’re doin’ this.
Whisking together chocolate for making vegan chocolate ice cream

This recipe requires just 6 ingredients and simple methods. If you can whisk, blend, and pour into an ice cream maker, you can master this easy recipe.

The base is comprised of water, cocoa powder, rich coconut cream, and organic cane sugar, which is whisked together. Then comes the deep chocolate flavor: from plenty of vegan dark chocolate.

The last ingredient is vanilla extract, which enhances the flavor and helps prevent ice crystals (because of the alcohol content). Then simply blend, chill, and wait patiently until it’s time to churn.

This ice cream is insanely creamy and so, so rich in chocolate flavor. It satisfied that craving I had for the chocolate ice cream I enjoyed back in my dairy-eating days.

# Ingredients
US Customary – Metric

    180 ml water
    300 ml lite coconut milk
    133 g organic cane sugar*
    57 g unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/4 tsp sea salt
    170 g vegan dark chocolate (finely chopped // ~1 cup chopped per 6 ounces)
    1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

# Instructions

    1. The day before, add your ice cream churning bowl* to the freezer to properly chill.
    2. The same day, prepare your base. Add the water, coconut milk, cane sugar, cocoa powder, and salt to a large saucepan and whisk to combine. Bring to a low boil over medium-high heat, whisking frequently. Once it reaches a low boil, continue cooking and whisking for 1 minute.
    3. Remove from the heat and add the chocolate and vanilla. Whisk until melted.
    4. Then transfer to a mixing bowl and chill in the fridge for 2 hours or until room temperature or cooler. Optional: To remove any graininess, add to a blender and blend for 30 seconds on high. 
    5. Add your chilled base to the ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions – about 30 minutes or until it looks like soft serve (see photo).
    6. Enjoy as soft serve, or transfer to a parchment-lined dish or loaf pan, cover securely, and freeze for 4-6 hours, or until firm.
    7 Let thaw 10-15 minutes before serving to soften. Use a hop scoop to ease scooping. Enjoy within 7-10 days. This is excellent with ripe strawberries and coconut whipped cream!
